# Automatical-window
This project for Automatical Window.
If it rains when you are outside, it is hard to close the windows that are open at home.
So I want to make this device.
With Using Arduino Uno R3 , RGB LED, blutooth sensor(HC-06), rain sensor, step motor(SERVO 9G), RGB LED sensor, temperature sensor,
humidity sensor, Manual Buzzer, fire sensor(D09)
using App inventor
ivanseidel/ArduinoThread (MIT lisence) - library,
Servo (GNU lisence) -library
IRremote - library

===== A0 is Raindrop  sensor
===== A1 is Temperatur sensor
===== A2 is Humidity sensor

===== 2,3 = Blutooth sensor(HC-06)
===== 4 = raindrop
===== 5 = servo
